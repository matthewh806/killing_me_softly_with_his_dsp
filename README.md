![monolith](assets/monolith_apes.jpeg?raw=true "The Monolith")

A collection of small audio experiments, test applications, prototypes, a research dumping ground etc etc etc

## Getting Started

Firstly just clone the repository. `Juce` is required as a dependency as a
foundation for most of the projects and is included here as a git submodule so
should also be retrieved:

```
  git clone git@github.com:matthewh806/killing_me_softly_with_his_dsp.git
  git submodule update --init --recursive
```

For further instructions on compiling check the README in the code directory.
