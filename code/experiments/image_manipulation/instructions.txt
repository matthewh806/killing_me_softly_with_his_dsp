SoxMosh

A python tool for applying audio effects (delay, reverb, filtering) to images using the pysox library

The program is command line only (at the moment!), to run it use the following pattern:

    ./soxmosh_cli input_image output_image effects

where input_image & output_image are paths to a an image on disk (preferably bitmap) and effects is 
a path to a json structure containing the effects / parameters to apply (see the example bundled in the zip
for an idea of how to structure it)

Using the provided image & effects file call:

    ./soxmosh_cli perfect_blue_face.bmp perfect_face_moshed.bmp example_effects.json

which will output an edited bitmap image to "perfect_face_moshed.bmp" in the same directory. 

For a full list of the transormations / effects that can be applied see:
