## About

Yo, check it. This here's the Freeverb VST, the realest reverb you ever heard. Ain't no fake shit, ain't no gimmicks. Just pure, unadulterated reverb, straight outta the open source library.

Now, you might be thinking, "Why the hell would I need another reverb plugin?" Well, let me tell you, this ain't just any reverb. This is the Freeverb, son. It's got all the parameters you need to get that perfect sound: room size, damping, wet/dry mix, width, mode, and now with the latest update, even predelay. Ain't no sound you can't shape with this bad boy.

But don't just take my word for it. Give it a try yourself. Load it up on your DAW and start tweaking. You'll see what I mean. This is the real deal.

So don't sleep on the Freeverb VST. Get it now and take your sound to the next level. Trust me, you won't regret it.

##  TODO:

- [ ] Ask GPT to add a predelay parameter
- [ ] Fix the .uidesc file that GPT generated
- [ ] Ask GPT about possible optimisations to the existing code
- [ ] Ask GPT to generate different tunings
- [ ] Ask GPT to generate the code for supporting different types of reverb (e.g. Convolution)
